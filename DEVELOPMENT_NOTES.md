# ﻿🛠️ Development Notes: Google Docs Change Tracker Script
This script monitors a shared Google Document, detects newly added lines, and emails those changes to all collaborators (viewers, editors, commenters, and owner). The script was developed as part of a collaborative exercise between Romel P and ChatGPT.

## 🎯 Goals

✅ Track line-level changes in a Google Doc

✅ Automatically email updates to collaborators

✅ Store and compare previous document state

✅ Display readable bullet lists in the email

✅ Maintain best practices and use helper functions for modularity

## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

- Use of DocumentApp.getActiveDocument() to access the current document

- Storage and retrieval of last document state using PropertiesService

- Filtering and trimming logic using .split, .map, .trim, and .filter

- Extraction of collaborators using DriveApp.getFileById()

  - Includes viewers, editors, commenters, and owner

- Logging execution timestamps in Eastern Time (12-hour format)

- Output of metrics like number of new lines and recipients

- Email sent using MailApp.sendEmail with all recipients in BCC

- URLs and bullet lists are formatted for clear readability

## 📅 Development Milestones & Enhancements

#### 🕒 2025-05-14

- Initial concept and goals established

- Decided to use DocumentApp.getActiveDocument() to tie script to current doc

#### 🕒 2025-05-15

- Implemented change detection via comparison of current and previous document lines

- Introduced logging with Logger.log() for timestamps and debugging values

- Logger.log("Script run at: %s", getEasternTimeString());

#### 🕒 2025-05-16

- Added helper function to extract viewers, editors, commenters, and owner:

  - function getPeopleWithAccessToActiveDoc() { ... }

- Introduced .map(u => u.getEmail()) and .join("\n") to format logs

- Logged number of recipients:

- Logger.log("📬 Number of recipients: %s", recipients.length);

#### 🕒 2025-05-17

- Integrated formatted bullet list:

  - function formatAsBulletList(lines) { ... }

- Updated email body with link to document and bullet points of changes

#### 🕒 2025-05-18

- Adjusted time formatting for EST/EDT and 12-hour clock:

  - Utilities.formatDate(now, "America/New_York", "yyyy-MM-dd h:mm:ss a z");

- Resolved Gmail bounceback issue with BCC field usage

## 📘 Script Composition

The script uses the following helper functions:

  - getPeopleWithAccessToActiveDoc() – Retrieves all collaborators

  - formatAsBulletList(lines) – Formats an array of strings as bullet points

  - getEasternTimeString() – Formats current time to Eastern Time in readable format

The main execution function:

  - checkDocAndEmailChanges() – Logs changes, prepares and sends email

## 🧪 Debugging Techniques Used

- Logger.log() was used to output:

  - Timestamp of each execution

  - Number and contents of new lines

  - List of recipient email addresses categorized by role

- Use of breakpoints to pause and inspect variables

- Discussion of split, map, trim, and filter operations

- Consideration of script execution limits and batching

## 📋 Noteworthy Challenges and Resolutions

- Ensuring all user types (including owner) are captured

- Formatting bullet lists and hyperlinks in plain text email

- Customizing script time zone display and 12-hour formatting

## 🔐 Permissions Note

- Google Apps Script APIs (DriveApp, MailApp) respect permissions of the account executing the script.

- The script uses getActiveDocument(), so it runs in the context of the currently open document.

- Supports reuse and modification for related workflow automations
